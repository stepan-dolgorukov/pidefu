# Pidefu

Build PDF in isolation from source file in Markdown.

# Motivation

The program was originally developed to create resumes that were easy to read
for both humans and parsers when applying for a job. The author supports build
of artifacts in an isolated environment. The project has been in active but not
intensive development since September 2023.

# Build PDF

```shell
chmod u+x pidefu.sh
