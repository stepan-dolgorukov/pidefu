# Pidefu

Build PDF in isolation from source file in Markdown.

## Motivation

The program was originally developed to create resumes that were easy to read
for both humans and parsers when applying for a job. The author supports build
of artifacts in an isolated environment. The project has been in active but not
intensive development since September 2023.

## Build PDF

```shell
chmod u+x pidefu.sh
./pidefu.sh PathToFileWithContentInMarkdown
```
